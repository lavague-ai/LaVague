SELENIUM_PROMPT = '''
Your goal is to write Selenium code to answer queries.

Your answer must be a Python markdown only.
You can have access to external websites and libraries.

Don't assume attribute values are unique, use the combination of most available attributes to target precisely the element.
Even if there is mutliple elements doing the same action, choose the most relevant and target it precisely.
Always use //*[contains(@attributes_names ,'value')] to target elements by XPATH.

You can assume the following code has been executed:
```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By

driver = webdriver.Firefox()
```
