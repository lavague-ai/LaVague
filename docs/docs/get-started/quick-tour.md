# LaVague Quick Tour

In this quick tour we'll show you how you can use the LaVague CLI to test out using our Large Action Model to perform actions on web from natural language instructions.

We'll get you started with our two CLI commands:
- `lavague launch`: Launch an interactive in-browser Gradio demo where you can test out instructing LaVague to perform actions on a website!
- `lavague build`: Get the raw Python code generated by LaVague which you can then execute locally

!!! note Pre-requisites
    - Make sure you've already [installed LaVague](https://docs.lavague.ai/en/latest/docs/get-started/setting-up-la-vague/)
    - Our default demo uses the OpenAI API. You will need to have an OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable set in your local environment

    > To use LaVague with a different LLM API, see our [integrations](https://docs.lavague.ai/en/latest/docs/integrations/home/) section

> If you prefer to run this quick tour as end-to-end Google Colab notebook, follow [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/lavague-ai/lavague/blob/main/docs/docs/get-started/quick-tour-notebook/quick-tour.ipynb)

## LaVague Launch

The LaVague CLI requires currently require a configuration and instructions file to be supplied. You can download out default files with the following command:

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lavague-ai/LaVague/main/examples/configurations/api/openai_api.py && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lavague-ai/LaVague/main/examples/instructions/huggingface.yaml`

You can now run LaVague launch with the following command:

`lavague -c openai_api.py -i huggingface.yaml launch`

!!! note 'arguments'

    - The `--instructions` or `-i` option accepts a yaml file containing: the URL of the website we will interact with & the instructions for the actions we wish to automate
    -  The `--config` or `-c` option with a Python file which can be used to set a desired LLM, embedder etc.

    For more info on these, see the [customization guide](https://docs.lavague.ai/en/latest/docs/get-started/customization/)!

You can now click on the public (if you are using Google Colab) or local URL to open your interactive LaVague demo.

You'll need to manually interact with this demo:

1) Click on the URL textbox and press enter. This will show a screenshot of your initial page.

2) Then select an instruction or write your own, and again click within the instruction textbox and press enter.

At this point, your Python code leveraging Selenium is generated by the LLM & executed. You will see an updated image of the website after the code is executed.

Feel free to test our different URLs or instructions!

## LaVague Build

We can use the `lavague build` command with the [previously downloaded files](#lavague-launch) to generate a file containing this automation code without launching an interactive demo:

`lavague -c openai_api.py -i huggingface.yaml build`

This creates a Python script in your current directory named `hf_openai_api_gen.py` - a combination of the two input file names separated by a `_` character with a `_gen` suffix.

We can now inspect the code and execute it locally!
