# Installation

In this section, we're going to walk you through how you can install and set up everything you need to run LaVague locally.

> If you just want to test out LaVague without having to install anything locally, you can run our [Quick Tour notebook with Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/lavague-ai/lavague/blob/main/docs/docs/get-started/quick-tour-notebook/quick-tour.ipynb).

To start using LaVague, we need to install a webdriver and store it in our home directory, so that LaVague can interact with the browser using underlying automation tool `Selenium`. We will then also install the LaVague package.

!!! note "Playwright integration"
    Alternatively, we support using Playwright for our `lavague build` command, which does not require webdriver installation. With the `lavague build` CLI command, you can generate Python files with automation code to carry out actions from text instructions! See our [playwright guide](./playwright.md) to see how to get started with Playright. 

We provide two key installation options:

- Setting up LaVague in your environment [with our installation script](#local-setup)
- Running LaVague with [the Lavague docker image](#lavague-docker-image)

### Local setup

To set-up LaVague in your local linux environment, you can run our `setup.sh` script:

`sudo bash setup.sh`

To set-up LaVague in your local macos environment, you can run our `setup-macos.sh` script:

`sudo bash setup-macos.sh`

This will perform all necessary steps to set-up LaVague.

> Feel free to inspect the script before running it.
Also I notice you mention managed version of LaVague is also in preparation so that almost nothing needs to be installed for a quick start! (Of course, people can consume/host models to use LaVague)

### LaVague with docker

⚠️ Pre-requisites:

- 🐋 Docker: Ensure Docker is installed and running on your machine

To use LaVague with our docker image you will first need to:

1. Pull the latest LaVague docker image:

`docker pull lavagueai/lavague:latest`

2. Use `docker run` with the LaVague command of your choice:

`docker run -v /home/$USER/LaVague/lavague-files:/home/vscode/lavague-files -e OPENAI_API_KEY=[YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY] lavagueai/lavague:latest build`

⚠️ Make sure to replace the `[YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY]` placeholder with your OpenAI API key.

If you end your docker run command with:

- `build`: it will execute `lavague -i instructions.yaml -c config.py build` from the root of your `lavague-files` mounted volume
- `launch`: it will execute `lavague -i instructions.yaml -c config.py launch` from the root of your `lavague-files` mounted volume
- `a custom command`: it will execute this command, for example, `lavague -i custom_instructions.yaml -config_path custom_config.py build`

⚠️ In the latter case, make sure you place the relevant files in your mounted `lavague-files` volume!

???+ info "Docker run command in more detail"

    - We need to mount the lavague-files volume with the `-v /home/$USER/LaVague/lavague-files:/home/vscode/lavague-files` option so that you can easily customize your config and instructions files and can easily acess LaVague's output files from the `build` command.

    - When using `lavague [OPTIONS] launch`, we need to ensure we bind the host system port 7860 with the container port 7860 by using the `-p 7860:7860` option. This enables us to see the Gradio generated by `lavague [OPTIONS] launch` in the container, on localhost:7860 on our local machine.

    - Any environment variables required to run our command, such as your `OPENAI_API_KEY` should be specified with the `-e` option.

### 🚨 Disclaimer

This project executes LLM-generated code using `exec`. This is not considered a safe practice. We therefore recommend taking extra care when using LaVague (such as running LaVague in a sandboxed environment)!

## Conclusions

You are now ready to use LaVague with the integration of your choice. To see how to do this with our CLI, see our [quick tour](./quick-tour.ipynb) or [integration pages](../integrations/api/hugging-face.ipynb).
