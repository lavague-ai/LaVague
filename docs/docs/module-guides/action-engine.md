# Action Engine

### What is the Action Engine?

The Action Engine module is responsible for transforming natural language instructions into [Actions](../learn/actions.md) and executing them.

The Action Engine module contains three sub-engines:

- 🚄 Navigation Engine: Generates and executes Selenium code to perform an action on a web page
- 🐍 Python Engine: Generates and executes code for tasks that do not involve navigating or interacting with a web page, such as extracting information
- 🕹️ Navigation Control: Performs frequently required navigation tasks without needing to make any extra LLM calls. So far we cover: scroll up, scroll down & wait


### Getting started with the Action Engine

In our agentic workflow, the agent first gets the next instruction and the name of the next sub-engine to be used from the World Model. 

This information is then sent to the Action Engine through the `dispatch_instruction` method. 

We can test out this method directly with the Action Engine:

```python
from lavague.drivers.selenium import SeleniumDriver
from lavague.core import ActionEngine

selenium_driver = SeleniumDriver(headless=False, url="https://huggingface.co/")
action_engine = ActionEngine(
    driver=selenium_driver,
)

# Dispatch an instruction to the Navigation Engine
engine_name = "Navigation Engine"
instruction = "Click on the Models button in the top menu"

# Execute the instruction and get the output if applicable
output = action_engine.dispatch_instruction(engine_name, instruction)
```

The `dispatch_instruction` method will call the `execute_instruction` method for the relevant sub-engine, which will:

In the case of the Navigation and Python engines:

- Performs RAG - it is at this point we use the Action Engine's `embedding` model
- Queries the `LLM` with our `prompt template` to generate the code needed to perform our action
- Runs the `extractor` or cleaning function to extract code only from our LLM response

And in all cases then:

- Executes the action using the Action Engine's `driver`
- Logs information about the action process with the Engine's `logger`

The `dispatch_instruction` method returns an `ActionResult` object, which contains:

    - instruction: the instruction an action was generated for
    - code: the generated code for the action
    - success: whether the code was executed successfully or not
    - output: the output of executing the action where relevant, such as the result of a knowledge retrieval action using the Python Engine

> Note, the Navigation Control skips the RAG and LLM query steps by using pre-defined code for common navigation tasks

### Customizing an Action Engine's 

#### Action Engine from Context

You can customize the `LLM` and `embedding model` used by the Action Engine by instantiating it with the `ActionEngine.from_context` method and passing it a `Context`.

Details on how to do this are provided in our [customization guide](../get-started/customization.md).

#### Action Engine optional parameters

There are also numerous optional arguments that can be passed to the Action Engine, alongside the required `driver` argument, which you can view here:

### Display mode

A final thing to note is the Action Engine's `set_display` method. 

This method is used by the `Web Agent` when its `run` method is passed a `display=True` boolean value:

```py
agent.run(objective, display=True)
```

When `display` is set to True, the Action Engine will display images updated in real-time as actions are performed on our browser. This can be useful when we are using the driver in headless mode and still want to visually see the impact of our actions.

We can also use this method directly on the Action Engine with the following code:
```py
action_engine.set_display(True)
```
